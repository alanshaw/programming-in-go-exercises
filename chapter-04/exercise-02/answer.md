The statement `x := 5` creates a new variable x and assigns the value 5 to it.

`x += 1` is shorthand for `x = x + 1`.

`x = x + 1` retrieves the current value of `x`, adds `1` to it, and assigns it back to x.

Since `x` has the value `5` initially, `x` is assigned the value `6` after the statement `x += 1` is run.
