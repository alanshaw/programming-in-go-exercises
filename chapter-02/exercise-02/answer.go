/*
Comments are line(s) of text written by developers for other developers to
read, which are ignored by the go compiler.

The two types are:

1. Multiline (like this one) started by a slash followed by a star and ended 
by a star followed by a slash.

2. Single line (like the following example) started by two slashes and ended
by a newline character at the end of the line.

// This is a single line comment
