# Exercise answers from "An Introduction to Programming in Go"

## Getting started

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Exercises are organised by chapter and exercise number. For example, question 1 from chapter 2 can be found at `/chapter-02/exercise-01`. Using a command terminal, `cd` into the directory of the chapter/exercise you want.
3. All exercises have a `quesiton.md` which is contains the question. For written answers you'll find an `answer.md`, and for coding problems you find the answers in `answer.go` file or files.
